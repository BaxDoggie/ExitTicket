Exit Ticket – Digital Archaeology 

When I began this course, I wasn’t entirely sure what digital archaeology really was. I had taken archaeology and history classes before, and as a cognitive science student in the computation stream, I already had experience with coding and technical tools. But digital archaeology wasn’t quite any of those things, it felt familiar in fragments, but unfamiliar as a whole. Over the term, through the projects, the weekly reflections, and the consolidation assignments, I began to understand digital archaeology as something much more than a bundle of technical workflows. It is a way of thinking, questioning, and interpreting. This exit ticket brings together the work I completed across Modules 1–3 and reflects on how I’ve moved from curiosity to a much clearer sense of what digital archaeology can be. 

 

View On Digital Archeology 

At the beginning of the course, I mostly thought of digital archaeology as a set of borrowed tools, GIS, machine learning, mapping, simulations, all taken from other fields and repurposed for archaeological questions. But through the readings and my own projects, especially the reflections from Modules 2 and 3, I realized this view was too narrow. 

Working with the Roman coin classifier in Module 2 and then returning to it in Module 3 helped me see that digital archaeology shapes interpretation just as much as it supports it. Revisiting the classifier taught me how sensitive computational tools are to dataset design, and how “slow data,” as Huggett describes, is what actually grounds fast computational processes. This shifted my thinking about the field. Rather than being a follower that simply borrows methods, digital archaeology actively contributes new ways of seeing patterns, asking questions, and structuring evidence. By the time I wrote my Module 3 reflection, I understood digital archaeology as a hybrid perspective, one that exists at the intersection of computing, data, visualization, and traditional archaeological reasoning. 

This evolution in my thinking aligns with the first learning outcome: understanding how digital archaeology has emerged, how it continues to evolve, and how its questions push beyond tool use toward methodological and interpretive contributions. 

 

Implementing and Contributing to a Digital Survey 

Module 1 required us to build a web map and contribute to a digital gravestone and monument survey. This involved learning KoboToolbox, collecting data in the field, collaborating with classmates, and designing a basic HTML map. Even though I had technical experience, these tasks forced me to think carefully about interpretation and ethics. 

Documenting graves wasn't just data entry, it required judgment about what to record, how to describe features, and how to balance thoroughness with respect for the deceased. Working with two classmates helped ensure consistency, and these collaborative choices directly shaped the final dataset. My difficulty redesigning the KoboToolbox form also underscored how complex archaeological data collection truly is. Even fields we left blank mattered, because they reflected gaps in knowledge rather than irrelevance. 

These experiences directly connect to the second learning outcome. I didn’t just implement a survey; I learned how methodological decisions, collaboration, and ethical awareness shape digital archaeological datasets long before analysis ever begins. 

 

Investigating Data Using Digital Methods 

The projects from Modules 2 and 3, especially the Roman coin classifier and the cemetery network analysis, gave me a concrete understanding of how digital archaeology investigates data. The classifier required me to search for consistent coin photographs, organize them into a usable dataset, and train a neural network model. The surprising part was how much of the “work” happened long before coding. I realized how important careful data preparation is, and how misleading results can be without it. 

Network analysis gave me a different perspective, more focused on relationships. Visualizing the cemetery dataset revealed clusters, bridges, and patterns that weren’t obvious from reading the raw spreadsheet. It demonstrated what Brughmans describes, networks allow us to explore structures of relationships directly, even though interpretation still requires archaeological thinking. 

Returning to the classifier in Module 3 pushed this learning further. By expanding the dataset and refining the workflow, I saw firsthand the difference between reproducing and replicating. Reproducing felt like following a recipe; replicating meant asking new questions and exploring how changes affect outcomes. This deepened my understanding of how digital archaeology engages with methods critically rather than passively. 

 

Developing Online Experiences 

The Module 1 web map may not have been the most technically complex piece of the course, but it taught me how even simple digital outputs become public-facing interpretations. Choosing which markers to include, how to style them, and what layers made sense were all small acts of interpretation. The process made me more aware of what it means to communicate archaeological results digitally. 

Later, the reflections and consolidations served as another form of online communication. They required me to articulate my reasoning, explain my choices, and connect them to course concepts. While not “public archaeology” in the sense of a published exhibit, these documents still represent how I communicated my process and learning. 

 

Independent and Collaborative Work 

This online course required balancing independence with collaboration, which was reflected across all modules. I worked independently on the map, the classifier, and the network analysis, but I also relied on classmates for the gravestone survey and for annotation based discussions on the readings. Even the technical problems like disappearing annotations became part of the learning process, adapting and troubleshooting are core aspects of digital archaeology.

Across the modules, I developed workflows, organized datasets, revisited projects, and integrated feedback. These are transferable research skills, not just course tasks. 

 

Overall Assessment 

Looking back at where I started and where I am now, I feel I’ve met the learning outcomes through steady growth, reflection, and honest engagement with the process, even when things didn’t go as planned. I contributed meaningfully to the gravestone survey, built multiple digital methods projects, revisited and improved a classifier, explored network analysis, and thought deeply about the ethical and interpretive dimensions of digital archaeology. 

Considering the work completed, the evolution of my thinking, and the challenges I adapted to, I suggest an overall grade of 85 for the course. I feel this reflects strong engagement and real development, while acknowledging there is always room to continue learning and refining my skills.
